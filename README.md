# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository tracks my progress and solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) programming challenges.

## Repository Structure

The main directories are organized as follows:

- **`statements/`**: Contains the problem descriptions for each challenge.
- **`__tests__/`**: Holds test code and data. This includes tests to verify solutions against example inputs and potentially the full puzzle input.
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code implementing the solutions for each puzzle.
